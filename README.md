# 💫 About Me:
I am a robotics and embedded systems engineer specializing in intelligent autonomy for mobile robots and manipulators. My work focuses on AI-driven learning, motion planning, and computer vision, bridging research with real-world applications.<br><br>

@ **Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)**, I research **Active Vision using Deep Reinforcement Learning**, developing methods for **viewpoint selection and feature-driven exploration** to enhance robotic perception and manipulation. **Advised by Prof. Berk Calli.**<br><br>

@ **ARTPARK, Indian Institute of Science (IISc)**, I worked on **sensor fusion for localization**, implementing **Extended Kalman Filters** to integrate data from **LIDAR, GPS, IMU, and encoders**, validated on the **KITTI dataset**.<br><br>

@ **Bosch**, I was involved in **real-time ECU software integration**, working on **CI/CD pipelines, cybersecurity enhancements, and automated testing** for embedded automotive systems. My work included **flashing sequences, CAN configurations, and productivity improvements through automation**.
