# Atreya Bhat

Welcome to my space, where I blend the worlds of robotics, software engineering, and innovation. Let me give you a glimpse of what I'm up to!

## 🤖 Robotics Enthusiast
I'm a Robotics Engineer diving deep into the realm of intelligent machines, driven by a passion for exploring new horizons in this evolving field. With an academic background at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and hands-on experience at cutting-edge labs, I've got to engage working in the intersections of Planning, control, Sensor fusion and Vision based manipulation.

#### Research at WPI
- Engaged in pioneering research at WPI's Manipulation & Environmental Robotics Lab, spearheading developments in robot scrap cutting. I am implementing active vision algorithms and real time velocity control for the oxy-acetylene cutting operation. This has also led me to experiment with novel inverse kinematics and planning algorithms.  

## Past Experiences 

#### @ Bosch
- As a Software Engineer at Bosch, I started with Engine Control Unit (ECU) Software Integration and Cybersecurity. I later moved on to the role of Production coordinator, collaborating with different teams like Software, Hardware, Calibration and Production plants.

#### @ Indian Institute of Science
- I also interned at ARTPARK, Indian Institute of Science on topics of Localization and Sensor fusion.

## 🔭 Currently Working On
- Experimenting with advanced planning algorithms for next-gen robotic manipulators
- Learning and improving active vision algorithms


## 🌱 Constantly Learning
- Reinforcement learning applications in manipulation for adaptive behavior
- Computer Vision, Deep Learning for applications in Autonomous driving and flight

## 📸 Hobbies & Fun Facts
When not immersed in the world of robotics, I indulge in:
- 🚴‍♂️ Cycling adventures exploring new trails
- 📚 Reading [Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada) novels
- 📷 Capturing moments
