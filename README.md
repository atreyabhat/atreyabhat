Welcome to my space, where I blend the worlds of robotics, software engineering, and innovation. Let me give you a glimpse of what I'm up to!

## ü§ñ Robotics Enthusiast
I'm a Robotics Engineer diving deep into the realm of intelligent machines, driven by a passion for exploring new horizons in this evolving field. 
Why Robotics? Well, I just love the balance of multidisciplinary skillset it demands and the adrenaline rush it fills you up when stuff finally Works!! 

With an academic background at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and hands-on experience at cutting-edge labs, I've got to engage working in the intersections of Planning, control, Sensor fusion and Vision based manipulation. 

#### Research at WPI
- Engaged in pioneering research at WPI's [Manipulation & Environmental Robotics Lab](https://wp.wpi.edu/merlab/), spearheading developments in robot scrap cutting. I am implementing active vision algorithms and real time velocity control for the oxy-acetylene cutting operation. This has also led me to experiment with novel inverse kinematics and planning algorithms. Advised by [Prof. Berk Calli](https://berkcalli.com/)

## Past Experiences 

#### @ Bosch
- As a Software Engineer at Bosch, I started with Engine Control Unit (ECU) Software Integration and Cybersecurity. I later moved on to the role of Production coordinator, collaborating with different teams like Software, Hardware, Calibration and Production plants.

#### @ Indian Institute of Science
- I interned at [ARTPARK](https://artpark.in/), Indian Institute of Science and worked on Localization and Sensor fusion.

## üî≠ Currently Exploring ...
- Experimenting with advanced planning algorithms for next-gen robotic manipulators
- Learning and improving active vision algorithms


## üå± Constantly Learning
- Reinforcement learning applications in manipulation for adaptive behavior
- Computer Vision, Deep Learning for applications in Autonomous driving and flight

## üì∏ Hobbies & Fun Facts
When not immersed in the world of robotics, I indulge in:
- üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cycling adventures exploring new trails
- üìö Reading [Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada) novels
- üì∑ Capturing moments
