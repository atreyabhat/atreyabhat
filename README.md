# Atreya Bhat

Welcome to my space, where I blend the worlds of robotics, software engineering, and innovation. Let me give you a glimpse of what I'm up to!

## ü§ñ Robotics Enthusiast
I'm a Robotics Engineer diving deep into the realm of intelligent machines, driven by a passion for exploring new horizons in this evolving field. 
Why Robotics? Well, I just love the balance of multidisciplinary skillset it demands and the adrenaline rush it fills you up when stuff finally Works!! 

With an academic background at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and hands-on experience at cutting-edge labs, I've got to engage working in the intersections of Planning, control, Sensor fusion and Vision based manipulation.

#### Research at WPI
- Engaged in pioneering research at WPI's [Manipulation & Environmental Robotics Lab](https://wp.wpi.edu/merlab/), spearheading developments in robot scrap cutting. I am implementing active vision algorithms and real time velocity control for the oxy-acetylene cutting operation. This has also led me to experiment with novel inverse kinematics and planning algorithms. Advised by [Prof. Berk Calli](https://berkcalli.com/)

## Past Experiences 

#### @ Bosch
- As a Software Engineer at Bosch, I started with Engine Control Unit (ECU) Software Integration. I later moved on to the role of ECU Production coordinator, collaborating with different teams like Software, Hardware, Calibration and Production plants. Also gained experience with Cybersecurity in automotive embedded devices.

#### @ Indian Institute of Science
- I have worked at [ARTPARK](https://artpark.in/), Indian Institute of Science on Localization and Sensor fusion.

## üî≠ Currently Exploring ...
- Experimenting with advanced planning algorithms for next-gen robotic manipulators
- Learning and improving active vision algorithms


## üå± Constantly Learning
- Reinforcement learning applications in manipulation for adaptive behavior
- Computer Vision and Deep Learning


## üî¨ Ideas that worked - 

### Planning with Learned-Sampling distributions [Github](https://github.com/atreyabhat/LearnedSampling_CVAE/tree/main) - 2023
Developed an Encoder-Decoder network to learn sampling distributions, enhancing efficiency in motion planning.

### UAV Interception: Control & Trajectory Optimization [GitHub](https://github.com/atreyabhat/UAV-Interception) - 2023
Implemented and simulated a quadrotor with LQR control to approach and capture a UAV in 3D space. 

### Multi-Pose Object Pick and Place Robotic Arm [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LRGVmkzXYezZlSfqbuO5ebVDnbXRpKTM/view?usp=sharing) - 2021
Developed a robotic arm for grasping objects in different 2D poses and tracking moving targets in 3D space. An interesting approach without 3D camera but with a handeye configuration with a TimeOfFlight sensor to measure target distance for grasping. 

### Autonomous UV Sanitizing and Surveillance Rover [GitHub](https://github.com/atreyabhat/Aruco-Detector-and-Follower/tree/main) - 2020
Simulated a custom robot to move between multiple AruCo marker checkpoints with dynamic obstacle avoidance without a Lidar. Proposed to be used for COVID care centers.


## Publications

### Arecanut Tree-Climbing and Pesticide Spraying Robot with servo controlled nozzle - 2019
IEEE Global Conference for Advancement in Technology. [doi: 10.1109/GCAT47503.2019](https://doi.org/10.1109/GCAT47503.2019.8978452)
