# Atreya Bhat

Welcome to my space, where I blend the worlds of robotics, software engineering, and innovation. Let me give you a glimpse of what I'm up to!

## ü§ñ Robotics Enthusiast
I'm a Robotics Engineer diving deep into the realm of intelligent machines, driven by a passion for exploring new horizons in technology. With an academic background at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and hands-on experience at cutting-edge labs, I've honed my expertise in planning, control, and sensor fusion techniques.

#### Research at WPI
- Engaged in pioneering research at WPI's Manipulation & Environmental Robotics Lab, spearheading developments in robot scrap cutting. Delved into planning and control strategies, implementing real-time velocity control and MoveIt planners for precision tasks.

#### Embedded Engineering at Bosch
- As a Software Engineer at Bosch Global Software Technologies, I orchestrated Engine Control Unit (ECU) Software Integration, delved into AUTOSAR, CAN Configurations, and led Flashing sequence development. I 

#### Research Internship at ARTPARK
- Explored the depths of vehicle motion models, sensor fusion, and implemented cutting-edge algorithms like Classical and Extended Kalman Filters in C++ and Python for precise robot localization.

## üî≠ Currently Working On
- Experimenting with advanced planning algorithms for next-gen robotic manipulators
- Designing innovative control solutions for real-time execution in complex environments
- Exploring the fusion of vision-based perception and machine learning in robotics

## üå± Constantly Learning
- Reinforcement learning applications in robotics for adaptive behavior
- Exploring the frontiers of autonomous navigation in challenging terrains

## üì∏ Hobbies & Fun Facts
When not immersed in the world of robotics, I indulge in:
- üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cycling adventures exploring new trails
- üìö Reading Kannada novels and thrilling mysteries
- üì∑ Capturing moments through the lens of photography
