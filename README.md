# Atreya Bhat's Corner

Welcome to my digital abode, where I fuse the realms of robotics, software engineering, and innovation. Here's a sneak peek into my world!

## ü§ñ About Me
I'm Atreya Bhat, a Robotics Engineer on a mission to unlock the potential of intelligent machines. What draws me to robotics? It's the perfect blend of diverse skills and the exhilaration of seeing ideas come to life!

With a background from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and hands-on experience from leading labs, I've delved into the intersections of planning, control, learning, and vision-based manipulation.

#### Research at WPI
- At WPI's [Manipulation & Environmental Robotics Lab](https://wp.wpi.edu/merlab/), I'm at the forefront of developing cutting-edge solutions for robot scrap cutting. From refining active vision algorithms to exploring deep reinforcement learning for oxy-acetylene cutting, it's a journey of innovation. Mentored by [Prof. Berk Calli](https://berkcalli.com/)

## Past Experiences 

#### @ Bosch
- At Bosch, I kicked off with ECU Software Integration and later transitioned to the role of ECU Production Coordinator. My journey involved collaborating across teams to implement and test cybersecurity features for ECUs.

#### @ Indian Institute of Science
- My stint at [ARTPARK](https://artpark.in/), Indian Institute of Science focused on Localization and Sensor Fusion.

## üå± Constant Learning
- Exploring reinforcement learning applications in manipulation for adaptive behavior.
- Diving deeper into computer vision and deep learning.
